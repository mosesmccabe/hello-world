Hellow world

I'm Moses Peace Mccabe and I am excited to be part of the GitHub family. 
To tell you a little about myself.  I am a Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (EECS) major and I write most of my programs in C and C++. In my free time, I love just hanging out and meeting new people, doing research, reading, watching programming or electrical engineering videos on youtube, hiking, or finding other outdoorsy things to do.
